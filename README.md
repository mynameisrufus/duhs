# Direct Upper House system (DRAFT)

The Direct Upper House system places the voting citizens as the [upper house][upperhouse] through the use of an electronic platform.

Under the Direct Upper House system any existing form of [upper house][upperhouse] is replaced by a direct upper house. If the legislature does not have an [upper house][upperhouse] then the Direct Upper House system would be implemented.

The direct upper house vote is binding. The direct upper house must pass a majority of sixty percent for the legislation to pass after the ten percent threshold vote of the Law of Consideration is satisfied.

### Upper house legislation flow

1. Legislation drafted.
2. Amendments made.
3. Legislation goes into consideration queue.
4. Legislation blocks on [lower house][lowerhouse] legislation for consideration or legislation is moved to front of queue by popular up vote.
5. If legislation passes consideration the legislation is voted on by the direct upper house.

### Lower house legislation flow

1. Legislation drafted.
2. Amendments made.
3. Legislation goes into consideration queue.
4. If legislation passes consideration threshold then legislation goes to the direct upper house vote, if consideration threshold is not satisfied then legislation goes to a vote by lower house.

## Law of Collaboration

Individuals from the [lower house][lowerhouse] and direct upper house can draft legislation through the platform.

Anybody can propose amendments to the legislation regardless of legal status.  These amendments can be accepted or rejected by the individual who drafted the legislation.

It is up to the individual who drafted the legislation to finalise the legislation ready for consideration.

## Law of First Consideration

Laws finalised by the lower house take precedence in the consideration queue (_see_ terminology) over laws finalised by the direct upper house to ensure the routine functioning of government. However the direct upper house can vote a piece of legislation to the front of the consideration queue by reaching a ten percent up vote threshold through the platform.

## Law of Consideration

All upper house legislation must reach the ten percent consideration threshold to be voted on whereas legislation proposed by the lower house will go to a vote by the lower house when the consideration threshold is not reached.

The law of consideration prevents a disengaged upper house from holding up routine legislation required for the functioning of government due to the Law of Sequentiality.

## Law of Sequentiality

To prevent the lower house from gaming the system and flooding the platform with legislation to induce disengagement from the upper house in order to push through legislation, all legislation must come up for consideration for a period of two days.

Only one piece of legislation can come up for consideration at a time. If a piece of legislation reaches the ten percent threshold then the legislation becomes blocking, that is, no other legislation will go to consideration until the vote by the upper house has finished.

The deadline for the vote is five days after the threshold of consideration has been reached giving a total of seven days for a piece of legislation to go through the upper house.

## Law of Representation

Any member of the lower house can be removed from office at any time by the upper house in a separate process on the platform. 

When a member is proposed for removal a vote of eighty percent of the upper house or sixty percent of the members constituents will trigger a by-election through the platform.

## Law of Dissolution

The upper house can dissolve the lower house with vote of eighty percent and trigger an election through the platform.

## Law of Enshrinement

When a vote by citizens reaches the enshrinement threshold of eighty percent the legislation becomes enshrined.

Enshrined legislation will require vote that reaches the entrainment threshold to be repealed or amended.

Enshrined legislation can only be repealed or amended by the direct upper house.
