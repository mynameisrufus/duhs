# Direct Upper House system (DRAFT)

The Direct Upper House system places the voting citizens as the [upper house][upperhouse]. 
Under the Direct Upper House system any existing form of upper house is replaced 
by the Direct Upper House. If the existing system does not have an upper house 
then Direct Upper House system will be implemented.

The upper house has a binding vote. The upper house must pass a majority of
sixty percent for the legislation to pass after the ten percent threshold vote 
of the Law of Consideration is satisfied.

### Terminology

_Upper house_ refers to the voting citizens

_Lower house_ refers to the elected representatives of the citizens

_Platform_ a collection of tools enabling members of the upper house to
participate through electronic means.

_Threshold_ the percentage of votes from the upper house required for a
pre-requisite to be satisfied.

   is moved to front of queue by popular up vote.

   house.

### Lower house legislation flow

1. Draft
2. Amendments
3. Finalised
3. Legislation goes into consideration queue
4. If legislation passes consideration threshold then legislation goes to
   an upper house vote, if consideration threshold is not satisfied then
   legislation goes to a vote by lower house.

## Law of Collaboration

Individuals from the lower house and upper house can draft legislation through 
the platform. Anybody can propose amendments to the legislation regardless of 
legal status. These amendments can be accepted or rejected by the individual who 
drafted the legislation. It is up to the individual who drafted the legislation
to finalise the legislation ready for consideration.

## Law of First Consideration

Laws finalised by the lower house take precedence in the consideration queue over 
laws finalised by the upper house to ensure the routine functioning of government. 
However the upper house can vote a piece of legislation to the front of the 
consideration queue by reaching a ten percent up vote threshold through the 
platform.

## Law of Consideration

Not all legislation will garner enough interest from the public to be
considered. A threshold of ten percent by the upper house must be reached for a 
piece legislation to be considered. Once considered the legislation must then
go to the upper house for a final vote.

The law of consideration prevents a disengaged upper house from holding up 
routine legislation required for the functioning of government due to the Law 
of Sequentiality.

All upper house legislation must reach the consideration threshold to be
voted on whereas legislation proposed by the lower house will go to a vote
by the lower house when the consideration deadline has passed.

## Law of Sequentiality

To prevent the lower house from gaming the system and flooding the platform
with legislation to induce disinterest from the upper house in order to push 
through legislation, all legislation must come up for consideration for a period 
of two days.

Only one piece of legislation can come up for consideration at a time. If a 
piece of legislation reaches the ten percent threshold then the legislation
becomes blocking, that is, no other legislation will go to consideration until 
the vote by the upper house has finished. The deadline for the vote is five 
days after the threshold of consideration has been satisfied giving a total of
seven days for a piece of legislation to go through the upper house.

## Law of Representation

Any member of the lower house can be removed from office at any time by the 
upper house in a separate process on the platform. When a member is proposed for
removal a vote of sixty percent of the upper house or sixty percent of the 
members constituents (which ever is greater) will trigger a by election.

The election of members during existing election cycles also takes place through 
the platform.

## Law of Enshrinement

When a vote by citizens reaches the enshrinement threshold of eighty percent the 
legislation becomes enshrined. This piece of legislation will require the same 
threshold to be reached to repeal or amend the legislation.

Enshrined legislation can only be repealed or amended by an upper house vote.
